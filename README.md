# Git & GitHub Fundamentals 🚀

This is my first repository dedicated to mastering **Git** and **GitHub**. It serves as a practical sandbox to explore version control, branching strategies, and collaboration workflows.

### 🧠 Learning Objectives

The goal of this repository was to practice and document the core Git workflow:
- [x] Initializing a repository (`git init`).
- [x] Managing the staging area (`git add`).
- [x] Creating meaningful commits (`git commit`).
- [x] Connecting to a remote server (`git remote`).
- [x] Pushing and pulling code (`git push` / `git pull`).
- [x] Basic branching and merging (upcoming).
